After creating the JAR files, I've imported the JAR files into Eclipse again. I've checked that there's no compilation error.

Importing JAR files:
1. Open Eclipse.
2. Create a new Java Project. (File -> New -> Java Project)
3. Name the project.
4. Make sure execution environment JRE is "JavaSE-1.6" and click "OK".
5. Expand the project and find a folder called "src".
6. Right click on the folder "src" and select "Import".
7. Under "General", select "Archive File" and click "Next".
8. Click the "Browse..." button for "From archive file:" and select the JAR file you want to import.
9. Click "Finish".

Importing Reference Libraries JAR files:
1. Right click on the folder of the project.
2. Under "Build Path", select "Add External Archives...".
3. Select the JAR file and click "Open".
4. Repeat steps for each JAR file.

Running the application:
Note: All referenced libraries should be included too properly run the application (follow above steps to import them)
	Import taskapi.jar should import all required JAR files, but if not please include the following:
	*All found in the geoip_serivice/lib folder

2. Press the green play button on the toolbar.
